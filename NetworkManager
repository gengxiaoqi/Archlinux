Arch Linux is known for its minimalist and user-centric approach, which means users have full control over what software and services they install. When it comes to managing network connections, Arch offers multiple options—ranging from low-level tools like ip and dhcpcd to higher-level network managers like netctl and NetworkManager.

Among these options, NetworkManager stands out as a modern, user-friendly, and feature-rich tool that simplifies the management of wired, wireless, VPN, and mobile broadband connections. Developed by Red Hat and widely adopted in distributions like Fedora, Ubuntu, and Manjaro, NetworkManager can also be used effectively on Arch Linux.

In this guide, we’ll cover everything you need to enable and use NetworkManager on Arch Linux, including installation, configuration, and day-to-day usage.

Why Use NetworkManager?
Before diving into the technical steps, it’s worth understanding why NetworkManager might be the right choice for you:

User-friendly CLI (nmcli) and GUI (nmtui, nm-applet, plasma-nm)
Automatic connection management
Support for Wi-Fi, Ethernet, VPN, and more
Flexible profiles and connection priority
Systemd integration
Broad compatibility across desktop environments
If you’re looking for a hassle-free network experience on your Arch Linux system—especially on laptops—NetworkManager is an excellent choice.

Step 1: Remove Conflicting Network Tools
Before installing NetworkManager, it’s important to disable and remove any conflicting network services, such as dhcpcd, netctl, or wicd.

Check if conflicting services are enabled
systemctl list-unit-files | grep enabled
Disable conflicting services
sudo systemctl stop dhcpcd
sudo systemctl disable dhcpcd
sudo systemctl stop netctl
sudo systemctl disable netctl
You can remove them with:

sudo pacman -Rns dhcpcd netctl
Note: This is optional. You can keep them installed, but they must not be active at the same time as NetworkManager.

Step 2: Install NetworkManager
NetworkManager is available in the official Arch repositories. You can install it using pacman:

sudo pacman -S networkmanager
This will also pull in some dependencies, including libnm.

Step 3: Enable and Start NetworkManager
Once installed, enable the NetworkManager service so it starts automatically on boot:

sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager
Check its status to ensure it’s running:

systemctl status NetworkManager
You should see output indicating that the service is active and running.

Step 4: Using NetworkManager via CLI (nmcli)
NetworkManager includes a powerful command-line tool called nmcli. Let’s go through some common tasks using it.

Show device and connection status
nmcli device status
Scan for Wi-Fi networks
nmcli device wifi list
Connect to a Wi-Fi network
nmcli device wifi connect "SSID" password "your_password"
You can also connect using the interface name explicitly:

nmcli device wifi connect "SSID" password "your_password" ifname wlan0
Check active connections
nmcli connection show --active
Disconnect from a network
nmcli device disconnect wlan0
Connect to a wired network
Wired interfaces are usually managed automatically, but you can also set them up explicitly:

nmcli device connect eth0
Step 5: Using the Terminal User Interface (nmtui)
For those who prefer an interactive text-based interface, nmtui is a great alternative to nmcli.

Launch the interface
nmtui
You’ll see a menu with the following options:

Activate a connection
Set system hostname
Edit a connection
You can navigate using arrow keys and configure Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or VPN connections without needing to remember commands.

If nmtui is not installed, you can install it via:

sudo pacman -S network-manager-applet
(Note: this package also installs the tray applet for graphical environments.)

Step 6: NetworkManager in Desktop Environments
If you use a graphical desktop environment, you can benefit from a GUI front-end for NetworkManager.

GNOME
GNOME has native support via gnome-control-center and the top bar network menu.

KDE Plasma
Install plasma-nm:

sudo pacman -S plasma-nm
This provides a system tray applet and network configuration module.

XFCE/LXQt/Openbox
Install network-manager-applet:

sudo pacman -S network-manager-applet
It shows a tray icon that allows you to manage connections easily.

Step 7: Managing Connection Profiles
Every time you connect to a network, NetworkManager creates a connection profile. You can manage these profiles with nmcli.

List all profiles
nmcli connection show
Create a new profile manually
nmcli connection add type wifi ifname wlan0 con-name mywifi ssid "MySSID" -- wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-psk wifi-sec.psk "mypassword"
Modify a profile
nmcli connection modify mywifi ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses 192.168.1.100/24 ipv4.gateway 192.168.1.1
Delete a profile
nmcli connection delete mywifi
This profile system is handy for switching between networks at work, home, or public hotspots.

Step 8: VPN Support
NetworkManager supports VPN connections through plugins. Popular options include:

networkmanager-openvpn
networkmanager-pptp
networkmanager-l2tp
networkmanager-strongswan
Install OpenVPN support:

sudo pacman -S networkmanager-openvpn
After installation, you can import .ovpn files via:

nmcli connection import type openvpn file /path/to/config.ovpn
Or use a GUI like GNOME settings or nmtui to configure the VPN.

Step 9: Autoconnect and Priority
NetworkManager can automatically connect to saved profiles and allows you to set connection priority.

Set a connection to autoconnect
nmcli connection modify mywifi connection.autoconnect yes
Set priority (higher number = higher priority)
nmcli connection modify mywifi connection.autoconnect-priority 10
This is particularly useful when you have multiple known Wi-Fi networks.

Troubleshooting Tips
If something doesn’t work, here are some common troubleshooting steps:

Check device availability:

nmcli device
Restart the service:

sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
Log output:

journalctl -xeu NetworkManager
Reset a misbehaving profile:

nmcli connection delete <connection-name>
Conclusion
NetworkManager offers a modern and streamlined way to manage network connections on Arch Linux. Whether you’re a command-line enthusiast or prefer graphical tools, NetworkManager caters to a wide range of users and use cases.

With support for Wi-Fi, Ethernet, VPNs, and even mobile broadband, NetworkManager is a versatile and robust choice for anyone seeking convenient network management. Once set up, it can handle almost everything automatically, making your Arch Linux experience smoother and more enjoyable—especially on laptops and mobile devices.
