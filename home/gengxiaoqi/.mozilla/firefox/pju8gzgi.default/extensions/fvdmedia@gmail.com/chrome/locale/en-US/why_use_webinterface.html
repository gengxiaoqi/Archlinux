		Why would I need the interface of <a target="_blank" href="http://everhelper.me" >everhelper.me</a> at all if all of its<br/>
		features are available in the add-ons?
		</p>
		<p>Of course, you can enjoy the functionality of <a target="_blank" href="http://everhelper.me" >everhelper.me</a> without<br/>
		accessing the Web interface though it does have several specific<br/>
		features that may be of great use to you. For instance, it allows:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Creating additional backups</li>
		 	<li>Creating private bookmarks and dials</li>
			<li>Importing bookmarks from HTML files</li>
			<li>Copying bookmarks into and from FVD Speed Dial</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Plus, it gives you the access to your bookmarks from absolutely any<br/>
		browser, even one without our apps installed!</p>
